1) Looks like you have a class called `ticketcard.scss`, should we rename it to `TicketCard.scss` for consistency?
2) What do you think about moving the `Query.jsx` file to the same directory as the `Review.xx` files? We could rename it to `Review.query.jsx` as well to make it super clear that the query is for the Review component!
